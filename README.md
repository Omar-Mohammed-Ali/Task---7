# Task---7

Breast Cancer Classification using SVM

Tasks Performed
1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
   Dropped unnecessary columns.
   Encoded target labels (M=1, B=0).
   Standardized features for SVM.

2. Model Training
   Trained SVM classifiers with both **Linear** and **RBF** kernels.

3. Visualization
Plotted decision boundaries using the 2D feature space.

4. Hyperparameter Tuning
   Tuned C and gamma using Grid Search with Cross-Validation.

5. Model Evaluation
   Used 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the final model performance.
